# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

```text
One for X, one for me.
```

Where X is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name    |String to return
|:-------|:------------------
|Alice   |One for Alice, one for me.
|Bob     |One for Bob, one for me.
|        |One for you, one for me.
|Zaphod  |One for Zaphod, one for me.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest two_fer_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest two_fer_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`
